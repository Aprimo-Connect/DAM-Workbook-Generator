# DAM-Workbook-Generator

This tool can help you generate a workbook that outlines how your DAM is configured. The tool generates and Excel spreadsheet outlining configuration items and their properties in individual sheets (field definitions, classifications, rules etc.). The workbook is not intended to be later on re-imported to replicate the configuration into another environment. It is meant to purely provide a quick and easy way to document relevant configuration as it currently sits in your DAM. Note that the tool does not have the ability to export all aspects of configuration. It support exporting configuration of following objects:
- user groups
- field groups
- field definitions
- classifications
- classification permissions (access control)
- functional permissions (role permissions)
- settings
- watermarks
- translations
- rules
- content types
